While still intimidated by JS in general this week wasn't bad. The lesson gave me a really good opportunity to remember what I had learned in the webdev class I took some time ago.

The JS was actually really fun to mess around with, and I didnt realize how easy something like the console log was to do. I'm surprised and apprehensive by how easy this one was for me, its making me wonder if I'm really doing it correctly or am I doing something wrong with over confidence.

Before I test I am writing multiple console.log entries so I'm curious to see if they all work together or if the last will cascade the log and be the only to appear.
