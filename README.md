While still intimidated by JS in general this week wasn't bad. The lesson gave me a really good opportunity to remember what I had learned in the webdev class I took some time ago.

The JS was actually really fun to mess around with, and I didnt realize how easy something like the console log was to do. I'm surprised and apprehensive by how easy this one was for me, its making me wonder if I'm really doing it correctly or am I doing something wrong with over confidence.

Before I test I am writing multiple console.log entries so I'm curious to see if they all work together or if the last will cascade the log and be the only to appear.

1/26 UPDATE

Had some issues with the multiple console logs so I removed them and consolidated them. May try it again later once I've had some rest.
I had an issue with my directories that took a solid 15 minutes to figure out. I'm not used to working with multiple HW files; I've always just used the one and kept it updated if I recall. I tried to simply update the HW2 folder but either I was too impatient with GitHub Desktop's committing and push taking too long or I messed up somewhere along the lines. I think I did end up figuring it out, I had forgotten to correctly link the path in my html/index file.
On top of that I felt like a complete doofus for completely forgetting to link my index to my script file. BUT I did figure it out in the end thankfully.
Going to continue to mess with this throughout the night to see if I can get a cleaner list out of console log or if it will just have that word wrapped look for now.
