Week 3 update.
This one was hard.
I'm figuring out how to add buttons right now and just getting my story
and its progression straight.
I had a really late start to this week, but Im pluggin away pretty well.
The scripting of this piece is really confusing to me, or maybe my head is foggy.

I've definitely got my buttons down so thats good!
The preview extension is a life saver.

In the process of moving things around, my comments got messed up so that set me back a little.
