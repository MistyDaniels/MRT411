      <div class="container-fluid" id="storyIntro">
        <p>You awaken to darkness. A blindfold blocks your vision, but by the jarring rocking motion
          you are aware of the fact youre seated within a moving cart. The air is crisp and you can hear the
          hushed whispers of others around you.</p>

<!--Story Progression 1!-->
  <button onclick="choice1()" type="button" class="btn-warning btn-lg" id="blindFold">Remove your blindfold?</button>
  <button onclick="choice2()" type="button" class="btn-warning btn-lg" id="blindFold2">Leave your blindfold?</button>

      </div>

<!--If Removed!-->
      <div id="storyPart2">
        <p>You remove the blindfold, but find that your wrists and ankles are shackled together.
          The commotion has alerted your companions of your regained awareness.</p>
        <p>Ralof: Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there.</p>
        <p>You glance to your side to see a skittish thief seated beside you.</p>
        <p>Lokir: Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was
nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen
that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me -- we
should be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.</p>
        <p>After a short conversation you arrive in a small village. The Imperials have decided your
           fate. You are sentenced to death.</p>

<!--Story Progression 2 Removed blindfold!-->
             <button onclick="choice3()" type="button" class="btn-warning btn-lg" id="run">Run?</button>
             <button onclick="choice4()" type="button" class="btn-warning btn-lg" id="faceIt">Face your fate?</button>


<!--Story Progression 3 removed blindfold + Facing fate!-->

<div id="storyPart3">
    <p>Lokir the thief tries to flee when the lot is sentences to death. He is swiftly
  shot through with Imperial arrows.</p>
    <p>You resign yourself to your fate with the Stormcloaks and place your head upon the slab.</p>
    <p>A dull roar can be heard growing in the distance.</p>
    <p>Alduin perches himself upon the spires roof, his weight shaking the earth beneath him.</p>
    <p>His sudden appearance and the fire pouring from his mouth halt the execution, everyone flees for their life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ralof cuts your bonds and you make your escape to begin your journey as the Dragon Born.</p>

<!--Story Progression 2 remain blindfolded!-->

  <div id="badStoryPart2">
    <p>You decide to leave your blindfold.</p>
    <p>Whatever trouble you're already in isnt worth making worse.</p>
    <p>The rest of the group keeps their voices down, too low for you to hear.</p>
    <p>The cart stops and you are suddenly pulled from it.</p>
    <p>Its difficult to determine what is going on, but someone is shouting orders. It sounds as though
      you are in a great deal of trouble.</p>

      <button onclick="choice3()" type="button" class="btn-warning btn-lg" id="run">Run?</button>
      <button onclick="choice4()" type="button" class="btn-warning btn-lg" id="faceIt">Face your fate?</button>

<!--Story Progression 3 Run!-->

  <div id="badStorypart3">
      <p>Your adrenaline pumps in your ears.</p>
      <p>Before things can escalate you break into a spring, still bound.</p>
      <p>You run a few yards before Imperial arrows pierce your back.</p>
      <p>You hear someone call you a coward before everything fades to black</p>
      <p>...</p>
