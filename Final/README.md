I have most of the images from my Game Design classed copied over to my images folder.
Fortunately they weren't saved to my laptop (RIP).

Original idea: Interactive map that would allow you to zoom in on a rough
map of the game area. It would use a magnifying lens pointer possibly,
clicking would 'zoom' or bring up a pop up or something with more information about
either that area or another aspect of the game.

Alternate idea: If I cant figure that out! I'll make an interactive gallery that the
viewer can use to view some of the aspects of the game itself. Maybe make some detailed
areas similar to the 'zoom' function I was thinking about.

Got a pretty solid base so far. I want to get this all done before I get
down the knitty gritty of the rest that I know I'll struggle with.
So far I'm having some trouble getting my background to actual appear but
I think its just a matter of fixing a link or a small misstep in my styles.
