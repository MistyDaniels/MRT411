Started working on this project earlier this week but I messed up on my project folder
and ended up having to remake it and remove the previous project folder.
In the process I moved the original index.html to my HW 1 folder.
It was a mess; but I think I resolved it.
This week seems to be going better, I have a clearer head despite some glaring
issues but I think I'm doing a lot better with retaining what I'm learning in this class.
I have decided to reuse the story/choice material from my HW3 project that I haven't been able
to complete since I fell behind in all my classes last week. But I like the whole
Skyrim open, its fun and silly.
I finished changing all of my button submissions into text boxes for this week.
It actually went a lot better than I thought; but I am struggling with naming
conventions and retaining them in memory.
For now I've decided to place them in a notepad file so I can use that for reference
as I go along.

Having some trouble getting my options to change. I think I'm still struggling with
keeping the names in order. I don't know why thats so hard for me. May have to resort to
drawing a simple graph so I can maintain some kind of order.

I still cant figure out why my text box isn't working. I'll take a break and come back to it later.
For now I'll just continue to add the rest of my content.

I've added a little more but its really bothering me. Its a little late to be bugging anyone about it so I've tried going over the example provided. Everything seems to check out; I have a feeling its something frustratingly small.
