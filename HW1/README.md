This assignment was difficult because it has been at least a year since I
took my last coding class. Its been hard trying to remember everything I learned
in my web dev class.
I had to rely on the lesson, of course, tutorials I found online, and the
Professors example.
I was unfamiliar with certain components that I had never learned about;
Such as Parallax like scrolling.
I was able to use an old repo for reference from my previous class, which
actually came in handy as well.
