This assignment was difficult because it has been at least a year since I
took my last coding class. Its been hard trying to remember everything I learned
in my web dev class.
I had to rely on the lesson, of course, tutorials I found online, and the
Professors example.
I was unfamiliar with certain components that I had never learned about;
Such as Parallax like scrolling.
I was able to use an old repo for reference from my previous class, which
actually came in handy as well.


1/21/20 UPDATE

Altered some of the links that I had messed up. I also fixed some minor
text errors and played around with colors that would better match the aesthetic
that I'm going for.
Just a some tidying up here and there.
This week was a little difficult for personal reasons so hopefully I can start
on something a little more unique as time progresses.

I did have some trouble trying to realign my title background. Despite trying to center it kept expanding beyond parameters that I had set in a web based CSS and HTML tester I was using. I settled on setting it to the left, but it continued to have the same issue. I'll continue to mess with it as time goes by.
