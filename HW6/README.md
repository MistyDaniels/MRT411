NEW UPDATES:

Alright fresh week!
I started off picking up with the corrections that were supplied with me but I still havent been able to get my second row of images to appear. I'm not entirely sure why, but its right on the tip of my mind. I feel like I'm staring right at it and I'm sure its as simple as I just misnamed something or misspelled something. Either way I'm just going to continue on.

I do want to say I went with some pretty simple designs honestly. I wanted to use something fun like the matching game from the Super Mario Bros games but I didn't want to really steal the images, and from what I read on other online sources they were pretty commonly used. Though I suppose it will be easy enough to change the images later on if I decide. At least its pretty simple right now.

I FIGURED IT OUT I FORGOT TO ADD THE REST OF THE IMAGE TAGS IM SUCH A DOOFUS.

Alright I think I have the hang of things. The examples in the class videos are a godsend. I was able to kind of sort of grasp what I should be working towards.
I had a little trouble with the onclick event for some reason, but I think I got that figured out. I'm working on the JSON right now, it seems straight forward enough.
The preview package has really been helping with this but I want to run it right now in the browser juuust in case.

OK SO THAT MOSTLY WORKED! SUCCESS! SORT OF!
I really want to figure out how to reset the boxes so they revert back to white/blanks when I choose incorrectly but that may be a project for another day. I'm still happy with how well it turned out for a first try!

It didnt, however, progress past the point of all of the boxes being selected to display my information. HRM.

IM A BIG DUMB IDIOT AND FORGOT TO ACTUALLY SAVE THE UPDATES I MADE SO THATS WHY IT WASNT WORKING. oof.

One step forward and two steps back, it feels like. It will no longer progress past page1.html I think its not linked properly but Im just not seeing it. 






OLD UPDATES:

Figured out how to display at least the text for my first array.
Still having trouble trying to get the actual images to show up.
I created separate 'white card' blanks just in case I'd need that.
I figured it might make randomizing easier in the future.

For some reason I can only get on or the other array to print. That or get
either one to print twice. Too tired to figure it out for now, I'll try again after work tomorrow.

arrays continue to waterfall when I try, end up only printing the last 5.
Will e-mail teach in the morning.

I got stubborn and decided to figure it out myself to no avail :c I'm not sure if I should post my issue on the gitHub issues thread I'm afraid of looking really stupid haha.

I'm pretty sure I'm just not linking the images right and thats why theyre not showing,
but even when I try to use src it doesn't want to work.
I thought maybe I should use brackets instead of parenthesis but then the text didn't show up.

One thought is maybe I'm over complicating things? Maybe I could just display them on the page and then use JS later to make it interactive? I just feel like it my be really clunky and lack any real dynamism(?).
