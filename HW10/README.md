First off I hope that its ok that I'm using the teachers audio. I may change
it to my own later on, I just wanted a quick placeholder while I work on
everything else and get that together first.

I was able to get the canvas in pretty well, but I had been working in the
styles tag in my HTML and decided to move it over to a js file instead to try
to keep it a little cleaner looking. Since I moved it, it stopped working so
I may try to move it BACK to the HTML file. I guess it is HTML5 we're working on
so it would make more sense that it was there?
