This module has been difficult for me to wrap my head around. I feel like theres a lot being thrown at me that I'm just not absorbing but
I'm going to continue to go over the module again until it clicks. I'm just a little lost.
Decided to use the rick and morty dataset because why not.

I'm going to borrow the min.js file from the homework to test something.

I'm trying to get basic information working before completely implementing the
entire database because I'm really scared of messing up going further.
It seems to be working so far but I'm having an issue with the episode number.
I need to fix a few minor spelling/grammar errors but otherwise its fine.
I suppose my background color isnt really working either, and I need to figure out my table but thats pretty small stuff for now.
