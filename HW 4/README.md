Started working on this project earlier this week but I messed up on my project folder
and ended up having to remake it and remove the previous project folder.
In the process I moved the original index.html to my HW 1 folder.
It was a mess; but I think I resolved it.
This week seems to be going better, I have a clearer head despite some glaring
issues but I think I'm doing a lot better with retaining what I'm learning in this class.
I have decided to reuse the story/choice material from my HW3 project that I haven't been able
to complete since I fell behind in all my classes last week. But I like the whole
Skyrim open, its fun and silly.
I finished changing all of my button submissions into text boxes for this week.
It actually went a lot better than I thought; but I am struggling with naming
conventions and retaining them in memory.
For now I've decided to place them in a notepad file so I can use that for reference
as I go along.
