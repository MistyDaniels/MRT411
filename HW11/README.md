Late start but using some of the code from last week and the homework review
from this week has been helpful.
I'm of course starting by compiling all the needed folders and files in an order
that I'll be able to navigate easily. I'll slowly fill each of these files as I need.
I did like the method I used last week where I used a practice file/folder set
before incorporating them into my actual HW folders that I'll upload to gitHub.
I'll be implementing that again.
