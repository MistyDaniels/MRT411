Late start but using some of the code from last week and the homework review
from this week has been helpful.
I'm of course starting by compiling all the needed folders and files in an order
that I'll be able to navigate easily. I'll slowly fill each of these files as I need.
I did like the method I used last week where I used a practice file/folder set
before incorporating them into my actual HW folders that I'll upload to gitHub.
I'll be implementing that again.

I dont know what it is right now but my fingers are being all jumbly and dont want
to hit the right keys. Maybe too much caffeine. Definitely going to have to go through
as best as I can letter and check for syntax errors as I'm sure I'll have one or two.

I'm a little curious to see what would happen if I placed the three squares IN each
other. Would I be able to clip them into each other or would the program just not work at all?

I'm having trouble making my squares appear, I'm not sure why at these point. Going to keep
poking at my code. I know I probably forgot to put something super simple, but we'll see.
