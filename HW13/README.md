Had some trouble getting text to display even with the code from class.
Every time I trouble shoot, I cant seem to pinpoint exactly where I went wrong.
I decided to move on to my own object. While this isn't 'my own' per se, it is an STL file that I had on hand at least to test.
I purchased the STL file a while back on etsy to be used to 3d print later on and never had the opportunity with things getting cancelled.

Still having trouble figuring out how to link my own STL file into this document.

i'm not entirely sure why the cube and lines are now working in live server now that I've added a code test for the cube following the mouse.. but it sure is. HOWEVER its not working on github. Interesting.

still having trouble getting the helmet to actually appear. Will continue to edit it.
