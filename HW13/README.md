Had some trouble getting text to display even with the code from class.
Every time I trouble shoot, I cant seem to pinpoint exactly where I went wrong.
I decided to move on to my own object. While this isn't 'my own' per se, it is an STL file that I had on hand at least to test.
I purchased the STL file a while back on etsy to be used to 3d print later on and never had the opportunity with things getting cancelled.

Still having trouble figuring out how to link my own STL file into this document.
