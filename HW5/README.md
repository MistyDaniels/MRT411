Figured out how to display at least the text for my first array.
Still having trouble trying to get the actual images to show up.
I created separate 'white card' blanks just in case I'd need that.
I figured it might make randomizing easier in the future.

For some reason I can only get on or the other array to print. That or get
either one to print twice. Too tired to figure it out for now, I'll try again after work tomorrow.
