Figured out how to display at least the text for my first array.
Still having trouble trying to get the actual images to show up.
I created separate 'white card' blanks just in case I'd need that.
I figured it might make randomizing easier in the future.

For some reason I can only get on or the other array to print. That or get
either one to print twice. Too tired to figure it out for now, I'll try again after work tomorrow.

arrays continue to waterfall when I try, end up only printing the last 5.
Will e-mail teach in the morning.

I got stubborn and decided to figure it out myself to no avail :c I'm not sure if I should post my issue on the gitHub issues thread I'm afraid of looking really stupid haha.

I'm pretty sure I'm just not linking the images right and thats why theyre not showing,
but even when I try to use src it doesn't want to work.
I thought maybe I should use brackets instead of parenthesis but then the text didn't show up.

One thought is maybe I'm over complicating things? Maybe I could just display them on the page and then use JS later to make it interactive? I just feel like it my be really clunky and lack any real dynamism(?).
