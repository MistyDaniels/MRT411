I have most of the images from my Game Design classed copied over to my images folder.
Fortunately they weren't saved to my laptop (RIP).

Original idea: Interactive map that would allow you to zoom in on a rough
map of the game area. It would use a magnifying lens pointer possibly,
clicking would 'zoom' or bring up a pop up or something with more information about
either that area or another aspect of the game.

Alternate idea: If I cant figure that out! I'll make an interactive gallery that the
viewer can use to view some of the aspects of the game itself. Maybe make some detailed
areas similar to the 'zoom' function I was thinking about.

Got a pretty solid base so far. I want to get this all done before I get
down the knitty gritty of the rest that I know I'll struggle with.
So far I'm having some trouble getting my background to actual appear but
I think its just a matter of fixing a link or a small misstep in my styles.

OH BIG STEP! I found this cool code on github when I was looking for resources!
https://github.com/blasten/turn.js/
Its great because I think I can use this perfectly! The main thing is none of my
images are the same size! I'm hoping it'll still work and I can just set the size or
worst case scenario I can manually resize each image!

I can't get my containers to stop floating over each other >C I've looked online and I keep finding information about centering and shifting text but nothing for the containers themselves. I just need to move the containers.. containing my text. Hh. I'm sure its somethings stupid obvious.

The power went out and I lost anything I forgot to save, but I dont remember what that was so hopefully it wasn't important.

I couldn't figure it out so I went a different route with the flipbook code.
I'm still having the same trouble with the hero image, where my flipbook keeps floating over it and I cant fix it. I'm thinking of maybe moving the hero image down?

I changed the padding on the hero images and some of the dimensions and such of the flipbook and it works fine on Chrome and IE. Unfortunately I tried it on mobile and it looks really funky on Samsung Internet and doesn't really load on the other mobile explorer. Annoying. I thought it could be the flipbook doens't do well in mobile BUT the background and hero image doesn't load either so I'm not sure what's going on with that.
I think I'm just going to have to call it for now!
